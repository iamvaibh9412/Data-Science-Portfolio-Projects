We are a small team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing startups in an incredibly exciting space.

That's why we are looking for skilled, curious individuals who want to grow by surrounding themselves with a diverse array of outstanding people.
Our first product, Elvie Trainer, is an award-winning app-connected trainer that helps women strengthen the pelvic floor via fun, five-minute workouts. It took the wellness industry by storm and is now available via the NHS Supply Chain. Our street cred includes more than 12 awards for innovation and design, including the prestigious Red Dot Award and an IDA Design Award.
Our second innovation: Elvie Pump, the world’s first silent wearable breast pump, is making it possible for new mothers to pump anytime, anywhere. Elvie Pump has received international praise, including being listed as one of Times 100 best inventions in 2019 and ‘wearable design of the design of the year’ at the Dezeen Awards.
As a business, Elvie has received more than 30 awards, including being named as one of 15 startups “To Watch” by The Sunday Times, ranked as the 6th fastest growing business in the UK by SyndicateRoom in 2019. Tania Boler has recently been rated as the 8th most influential person shaping british technology in 2019 by Business Insider and both products have been featured in the Oscar Nominee Gift Bags.
In April 2019, Elvie announced a $42 million Series B from IPGL, Octopus Ventures and Impact Ventures, bringing the total raised thus far to over $50 million. Our Series B represented the largest ever fundraise in Femtech. This new round of financing will accelerate Elvie’s research and development efforts, as well as help grow brand awareness and distribution.We currently have offices in London, Shanghai and New York and planning to open a new R&D facility in Bristol in early 2020, while growing our Headquarter in London.

What does it mean to work at Elvie?

We are looking for a full-time or part-time Data Scientist to join our award winning team. For this role, we would ideally like you to be able to commit to a minimum of 4 days per week.

Our members are embedded in multi-disciplinary product teams from day one of development: understanding the science and championing best-practice, providing guidance on the most appropriate sources of data to power our products, and designing and building algorithms which will provide the most relevant and accurate insight to our users.
Our team members work closely with the Research Team to design and analyse user trials which inform the development of products and which occasionally spark ideas for new ones. Our involvement doesn't end after the product hits the market. We maintain comprehensive databases of user interactions and behaviour regarding our products and we take advantage of this resource to provide analyses and actionable insights on user behaviour and product performance.
Our approach to our work begins with a strong focus on exploratory analysis, scientific principles and the needs of the user. We are seeking individuals who appreciate the need to understand their data from a biological or physical perspective before they start building models and who habitually consider the impact of their decisions on the end user.
It's an exciting time to join us. We are expanding rapidly and as a Data Scientist embedded in the team in either London or Bristol, you will have a significant impact on new and existing products and contribute to developing the processes and tools used by the Data Team. We are guided by our company’s mission and vision, and we live and shape an open and friendly culture that does not shy away from challenging assumptions and stereotypes.

At Deliveroo we have a world class data science organisation, with a mission to enable the highest quality human and machine decision making. We work throughout the company - in product, business and platform teams. We are uniquely placed to connect and calibrate quantitative decision making throughout Deliveroo, and have strong relationships with our business partners.

Our team members use technical skills from the whole spectrum of data science: building analytical tools; informing decision making at all levels of the business via bespoke and automated analysis; running experiments; performing causal analysis; informing planning and prioritisation with robust impact estimates; building production machine learning and optimisation models; and upskilling the entire company in data literacy and data driven decision making.

At Deliveroo we're always experimenting. We have hungry customers, eager riders, and busy restaurants in 12 countries and over 200 cities and giving them what they want and need involves continually testing new ideas. Whether we're working to improve our restaurant recommendations or looking to find a more efficient algorithm for routing our drivers, experimentation helps us make the right decisions for our users.

Experimenting at this scale presents some unique challenges and we're investing heavily in building a world-class platform for designing, deploying, and analysing product experiments. We're looking for experts in statistical inference and estimation to join our growing team of data scientists and help us develop innovative statistical solutions for industrial-scale experimentation.


How can we monitor possible interaction effects across our experiments? How can we account for such effects in the analysis of our experiments?

How can we improve our inference techniques to correctly account for the many statistical tests we calculate? Once we have chosen such a correction, how can we account for it at the power calculation stage?

How can statistical methods help us estimate the long-term impact of experiments?

How can we leverage modern statistical algorithms in order to identify any business-relevant heterogeneity of treatment effects?

How can we avoid running afoul the selection bias across the many experiments we run? Can we use shrinkage estimators to get closer to the actual impact of an experiment once rolled out?

How can we use the outcomes of previous experiments to improve our inference for a given experiment?


Investigating complex methodological problems and working collaboratively with a small team of experts to establish world-class standards for experimentation.

Leveraging your broad statistical awareness to proactively identify opportunities to add to and improve our existing experimentation methods

Prototyping and amending statistical methods to fit our specific circumstances

Prototyping the code and providing clear communication and written documentation for the engineering team


PhD in statistics, economics, econometrics, or a relevant field of applied mathematics

Broad statistical awareness, including familiarity with frequentist and Bayesian approaches, and a demonstrated ability for developing innovative experimentation and analysis methods

Familiarity with a scripting language, some proficiency with Python would be an asset

We provide real-time cashflow forecasting & management that helps small businesses to be more confident in their financial decisions, and sleep a little better at night!
Our team was recognised as one of WIRED magazine’s top 10 London startups 2018 and the FinTech50 in 2019 / 2020.
Role Overview
This role sits at the intersection of engineering and data science - with the opportunity to work with our vast set of small business financial data to build predictive models for internal and external users. It is critical to not only care about the data and modelling but also upholding engineering best practices in data science products and beyond. Domain experience would be helpful, but not essential.
Responsibilities
Build and maintain models and data science tooling for our SaaS and funding product
Own your code/models and deploy into production. This is an engineering role with a data science specialisation
Understand the financial data of small businesses and extract insights to help our customers stay afloat
You will not always be working on data science projects so should be happy doing some data engineering
Requirements
Skills / Knowledge
As a data scientist, you will work on established systems as well as start projects from scratch - in both cases you’ll have a lot of autonomy and the chance to make a big impact. You should be happy taking the initiative and, at times, working independently
You should have a strong analytical background - for example, an MSc in a relevant discipline or sufficient self-study into statistical and data science concepts
We’re pragmatic about our technology choices, at the moment we use Python / PostgreSQL / BigQuery / Google Cloud Platform / Terraform / CircleCI
We practise continuous deployment with no test environments, so each PR gets merged to master and is in production within minutes. Last month we deployed 1030 times with 11 engineers.
We feel comfortable doing this because we practise TDD/CD. Constantly deploying small changes minimises big surprises and allows us to act quickly when something does go wrong
We practice test-first, outside-in TDD. We’re pragmatic about TDD, but given this is our main safety net we want our tests to provide value and invest time to make sure our approach is effective.
We operate in an open feedback culture where new ideas and new ways of working are always welcomed
We’re constantly seeking to better understand our infrastructure. All of our engineers work closely with our product and commercial teams to keep them in touch with the customer needs
Experience
You’re comfortable with using at least one programming language. We're pretty agnostic, but currently using Python a lot
You have a strong interest in data modelling
You’ve built up a good understanding of *nix command line including tools such as Bash and Git.
You’ve studied Designing Data Intensive Applications or have equivalent experience
Behaviours
You value honest feedback and creating an environment where it flourishes
You’re curious and constantly learning new things
You challenge the existing approach when you see the cliff edge racing towards us, but also get on board once the options have been debated and the team has made a decision
You're comfortably organised amongst chaos
You’re a broad thinker and have the capability to see the potential impact of decisions across the wider business
We strive to create an inclusive workplace where people have the opportunity to succeed, regardless of gender, gender identity, gender expression, sexual orientation, marital or civil partner status, race, religion or belief, disability, age or pregnancy
We embrace difference and know that if you can be yourself at work, you'll be happier, more motivated and creative. We want you to bring your whole self to work, to have your own perspective and know that you belong
Benefits
Equity. We want people to have a stake in the business so that all of our interests are aligned. It’s your baby too.
25 days holiday – and we will make you take it. Burnout is not big or clever.
Our Vitality health insurance covers your physical and mental health and provides you with a discounted gym membership and half-price health screens.

At the same time, people’s job security is at risk from rapidly evolving industries, robotics & AI, increasing demand for up-to-date technical, data, digital skills, and shorter job spans. Increasingly we are all transforming into lifelong learners, looking to upskill, reskill or entertain ourselves via effective educational content that provides quality, credentialed and recognised outcomes. In emerging markets the internet is accelerating this trend and opening up access to educational products from universities or institutions thousands of miles away, where previously cost, travel or admission requirements would have made study impossible. FutureLearn was founded in 2012 by the Open University, with the purpose of channeling these trends and transforming access to lifelong education. As part of FutureLearn you will be able to work within a stimulating, multidisciplinary, inclusive and diverse working environment that promotes collaboration, teamwork (AGILE framework), personal initiatives and career growth.

About the role
We are currently looking to recruit an experienced Data Scientist.

As a Data Scientist you will work on a diverse range of projects to solve key business problems, enable data-driven decision making and optimise and automate processes. You will be involved in the entire Data Science workflow. In practice, this means exploiting data of heterogeneous nature (financial, web logs, marketing, behavioural, course content) to scope, develop and deploy data-science products as well as producing self-contained statistical models and ad-hoc analyses to create business insights. FutureLearn has made significant investments into its data pipeline to enable fast, easy and scalable access to our data. Our data stack consists of Stitch, Snowflake, dbt and Looker. Python is the main programming language used for our Data-Science products and we mainly use Pyspark and AWS cloud tools to enable their scalability and automation. The Data Science team sits in the Data & Analytics Department and works alongside the Business Insights Analysts and Data Engineers.



At the moment, all FutureLearners work from home. When it is safe to go back into office, the working environment will be stimulating and fun, with lots of opportunities to collaborate, enjoy healthy snacks, good coffee and work out in the gym.

You'll have the opportunity to analyse, build, deploy and improve the machine learning systems that delight and protect our customers and help our customer support agents to operate swiftly and efficiently.
About Monzo

At Monzo, we're building a bank that is fair, transparent and a delight to use. We're growing extremely fast and have over 5 million customers in the UK, with over 100,000 new people joining every month. We've built a product that people love and more than 80% of our growth comes from word of mouth and referrals.

We are looking for people who are passionate about changing the way the industry works and who share our values. We believe in an open, transparent, highly diverse working environment where everyone is empowered to make changes. Following Stripe's example , all emails in the company are available for everyone to explore, and we discuss everything in Slack channels which are accessible by everyone in the company. You can see more about our plans on our public product roadmap , and sneak peeks of upcoming features in our community forum .
The data team

The data team's mission is to

Enable Monzo to Make Better Decisions, Faster

(1) product analytics, to help teams understand our customers and improve our app (2) domain analytics, to support teams who are working in specific banking disciplines (e.g., lending, finance, and financial crime), and (3) machine learning, where we design and build system that automate decisions across Monzo. While we take a flexible approach and frequently help each other across these areas, we each have one domain that is our primary focus.

For this role, we are looking for a Data Scientist who will focus on machine learning . The machine learning team partners with squads across all of Monzo to design, build, and experiment with machine learning systems that help them achieve their goals. For example, see our recent work with related articles in the app help screen , and the approach we took when building the help screen's search algorithm . This team is currently five Data Scientists and one backend Engineer - you can read about the shape of our team in 2020 here .
The role

You'll be joining the team to focus on production machine learning, working with many squads across Monzo to design, build, analyse, and experiment with machine learning systems that make use of the data we gather.

We organise our machine learning projects into three distinct phases; you'll spend your time doing all three:

Explore. We use BigQuery and Jupyter Notebooks to analyse data and design machine learning models for offline evaluation. For example, we are investigating machine learning powered assistants for our customer operations team, classifiers to detect financial fraud, and NLP models to improve the app's help screen.
Launch. We build Python micro services and cron jobs to put promising machine learning models into production. We are actively working on automating as much of this step as possible: our goal is for any Data Scientist to be able to deploy a promising new model to production in less than a day.
Iterate. We run A/B tests in partnership with other teams and analyse the results. Based on outcomes, we may decide to roll the model out to every customer or to explore improvements to the model for further testing.

What's special about data & machine learning at Monzo?

Autonomy. We believe that people reach their full potential when you can remove all the operational obstacles out of their way and let them run with their ideas. This comes together with a strong sense of ownership for your projects. At Monzo, you will get full access to our data and analytics infrastructure. When you discover something interesting, there is nothing stopping you from exploring and implementing your coolest ideas.

Cutting-edge managed infrastructure. All our data infrastructure lives on the Google Cloud Platform, so you don't need to spend your time configuring or managing clusters, databases, etc. If you want to train a Machine Learning model faster, just submit your training job to the Google AI Platform, no DevOps skills required.

Automation. We aim to automate as much as we can, so that every person in the team can focus on the things that humans do best. As with all data science work, there's some analysis and reporting, and as much as possible we encourage self-serve access to our data through Looker.


What we're doing sounds exciting, and you can't wait to explore our data
You're impact driven and eager to have a real positive impact on the company, product, users and very importantly your colleagues as well
You have a self-starter mindset; you proactively identify issues and opportunities and tackle them without being told to do so
You're a team player whom your colleagues can rely on
You have a solid grounding in SQL and Python, and are comfortable using them every day
You're happiest exploring data, designing and evaluating machine learning models and seeing these projects all the way through to production
You're excited about the potential of machine learning and can communicate those ideas to colleagues who are not familiar with the domain
You're adaptable, curious and enjoy learning new technologies and ideas

The data team's mission is to

Enable Monzo to Make Better Decisions, Faster

(1) product analytics, to help teams understand our customers and improve our app (2) domain analytics, to support teams who are working in specific banking disciplines (e.g., lending, operations, finance, and financial crime), and (3) machine learning, where we design and build system that automate decisions across Monzo. While we take a flexible approach and frequently help each other across these areas, we each have one domain as our primary focus. We work in cross-functional squads, so every data scientist is a member of the central data team as well as fully embedded into an area such as operations or product squads.

For this role, we are looking for a Data Scientist/Analyst who will focus on customer operations analytics . You'll be working at the intersection of the Data & Customer Operations teams.

The Customer Operations team looks after the tasks within Monzo that scale with customers. They're a crucial link between Monzo and our customers. Customer Operations spans multiple product squads, a planning team, an incubator team and almost 1,000 passionate COps (that's what we call our agents). All of these teams work to make sure we can support Monzo's explosive growth through running a variety of optimization projects for Customer Operations.
The role

The Customer Operations team are solving some of the most exciting problems in Monzo. There are lots of unsolved, hard problems where data plays a key part but you will also need to think deeply about people, product and process when solving these problems.


How do we balance (i) providing an amazing customer experience (ii) cultivating a positive and motivating culture for our customer support agents and (iii) being the most efficient and flexible operations team in the industry.
How can we automate our processes in a way that will allow us to scale to 1 billion customers and thousands of COps?
How can we measure and optimise a system that handles thousands of queries a week? What product improvements can we make? How can we understand if these are impactful?
What are our customers contacting us about & when/how can we automate the answer to their question? (partnering with the machine learning and software engineering teams)
How can we drive efficiency by 20% for our customer operations? What is the best way to measure efficiency?
What sets the most effective COps (the lovely customer support people who chat to our customers) apart?
What is a good customer experience? How can we measure this? How can we optimise for this?

You will help us make data-driven decisions and shape the direction of this exciting and evolving part of the Monzo business. We're looking for someone who cares deeply about understanding our business and customers, who can communicate their findings clearly to business partners and can drive actions on top of insights.
What's special about data at Monzo?

Autonomy. We believe that people reach their full potential when you can remove all the operational obstacles out of their way and let them run with their ideas. This comes together with a strong sense of ownership for your projects. At Monzo, you will get full access to our data and analytics infrastructure. When you discover something interesting, there is nothing stopping you from exploring and implementing your coolest ideas.

Cutting-edge managed infrastructure. All our data infrastructure lives on the Google Cloud Platform, so you don't need to spend your time configuring or managing clusters, databases, etc. If you want to train a Machine Learning model faster, just spin up a compute engine instances and submit a job from your local machine, no DevOps skills required.

Automation. We aim to automate as much as we can, so that every person in the team can focus on the things that humans do best. As with all data science work, there's some analysis and reporting, and as much as possible we encourage self-serve access to our data through Looker.


What we're doing here at Monzo excites you!

You want to have a real positive impact on the company, product, users and your colleagues

You pro-actively identify issues, and enjoy tackling them and coming up with solutions

You're comfortable getting hands-on and taking a step back to think strategically

You're a team player whom your colleagues can rely on

You have solid grounding in SQL and preferably Python

You are happiest exploring data, making discoveries and understanding their implications

You can manage multiple stakeholders with competing priorities

Logistics

We can help you relocate to London & we can sponsor visas.

Our interview process is normally a phone interview, a take home task and call to discuss it, and 2-3 hours of onsite interviews. We promise not to ask you any brain teasers or trick questions.

Diversity and inclusion is a priority for us – if we want to solve problems for people around the world, our team has to represent our customers. So we need to attract the best talent and create an environment that supports and includes them. You can read more about diversity and inclusion on our blog .

If you prefer to work part-time, from home or as a job-share, we'll make this happen whenever we can - whether this is to help you meet other commitments or strike a great work-life balance.

To reach Plan Zero , we need everyone to come together - not just as customers buying energy, but as members with a common goal. As part of this ambitious plan, our goal is to become the 'Leading Employer in the UK' by 2030. If you think you could be the talent we're looking for, then come and join the adventure!

We launched in 2009 with a mission to change energy for the better. Since then, we've welcomed over a million members, planted a million trees, and set our sights on helping save the planet.

As a Group , we're working to become a net zero carbon business by 2030, while helping our OVO Energy members halve their carbon footprints at the same time.

Green energy and technology are great tools to fight the climate crisis with. But it's people power that will rewrite history.

So we're building a zero carbon team inside and out. Of people who share our values, feel inspired by our mission, and want to make change happen. When you work for OVO, it's not just a job. It's the work of a lifetime. And we want the sharpest minds to help.

Up for the challenge?

Where in the world of OVO will I be working?

We are looking for an experienced data scientist or quantitative analyst to join the Trading desk at OVO. You will join a specialist team of data scientists collectively responsible for demand forecasting, forward curves and weather risk estimation on OVO's traded position.

After 10 years of trading, OVO has scaled rapidly, both in terms of customers on supply, and approach to data science. In the past 5 years, we have moved from spreadsheets, to parametric models in databases, to sophisticated statistical models written in Python and R. Overall we trade around £2B worth of power and gas a year, so small improvements in performance can make a big difference!

What will I be doing?

Work is varied, and can include anything from ad-hoc visual analysis of smart meter data, to deep-focus tasks such as developing monte-carlo models to estimate our exposure to commodity markets. Key responsibilities include:

Quantitative analysis of trading strategies to assess exposure and minimise risks.
Pricing exotic derivatives.
Modelling how much power and gas OVO's customers use.
Responding to changes in the market to facilitate trading decisions on the day.
Collaborating with trading tech to develop algorithms and data pipelines that are stable enough to auto-trade.

Python, SQL and Tableau are the main technologies used within the team. We tend to take a mixed model approach incorporating traditional timeseries models and modern data science techniques such as Nonparametric Regression 1 , Bayesian Statistics 2 , and Neural Networks 3 . As with any work in this area, there is also a fair amount of data wrangling involved, so be prepared to roll up your sleeves and dust off the terminal!

Is this the job for me?

Required Skills

Data Scientist,£69K - £75K (Glassdoor Est.),"Higher education is being rapidly disrupted by digitisation, globalisation and industry moving into the educational space.

Increasingly we are all transforming into lifelong learners, looking to upskill, reskill or entertain ourselves via effective educational content that provides quality, credentialed and recognised outcomes.

We are a team of over 100 culture-centric and product-centric people, and although we’ve made huge progress over the past few years, 99% of the problems we need to solve are still ahead of us.

With that in mind, we’re looking for more bright, passionate people to help us get there.
For the inside scoop on our culture and what working at Marshmallow is like, have a read of our culture handbook
Data Science at Marshmallow
Marshmallow recognised the importance and need for Data Science from the very early days: If you can select and price risks effectively and competitively in a dynamic marketplace then there are huge growth opportunities ahead. Data Science has been at, and continues to be at, the heart of a lot of these decisions. We don’t shy away from innovation and doing things differently, in fact we encourage and foster it.
In Data Science we recognise the importance of team culture and as a team we are very open and share as much as possible, the good and the bad. Data Science at Marshmallow offers the opportunity to be part of an ambitious team in a fast-growing company, working on very interesting problems that allow us to hit our goals and innovate significantly in the insurtech space. Communication is key to this and that’s why we have many rituals and forums of discussion: sprint planning and retros, daily stand-ups, round table discussions, exploratory time and a weekly happiness stand-up.
Role Description
Pricing is a key element to providing an insurance product, especially given most insurance providers are competing for business on price comparison websites with hundreds of providers. As a Senior Data Scientist you’ll work very closely with pricing on using data from third party integrations, modelling market movements, predicting underlying risks, exploring growth opportunities and much more!
As a Senior Data Scientist you will lead varied impact-driven analytical projects, including but not limited to building data pipelines and deploying and monitoring machine learning models. Our Data Science team sits very closely to Data Engineering and therefore we are also involved in topics such as remotely deployed tasks and analytics-ready data products. We are a high growth company and therefore prioritisation and delivery of projects is key to us meeting our ambitious goals. That said, you’ll have time to explore and implement novel approaches to solve long-standing industry problems.
The position offers the opportunity to work closely with our data science team Paul, Rob, Hannah, Emily and Morgan as well as engineers, product managers and business stakeholders. Additionally after 6-12 months this role can evolve to include line management of 1-2 more junior members of the team.
You can find out about our culture and what working at Marshmallow is like here.
Our data science career framework can be found here.
What you will achieve in your first 12 months at Marshmallow
Day to day you will be working closely with the pricing and data science teams on projects that drive growth for the company. We expect in your first four months to get up to speed with the basics of insurance pricing and familiarise yourself with our data sources and data infrastructure. In addition to this you’ll be involved in key pricing projects and will lead some projects yourself that help us achieve our goals over the next six months.
As you progress in your role we expect you to start forming a more holistic view of the current state of data science and pricing. You can add a lot of value by identifying pain points in these functions and help us iteratively improve as we grow. In addition to this you will start to lead more long-term complex modelling projects that are crucial as we continue to disrupt the insurance space.
Requirements Who you are
You will move fast by making decisions quickly to drive growth whilst not significantly increasing our underwriting risk.
You are selfless by helping and supporting your team continuously and upskilling colleagues where you can
You are open and honest by sharing mistakes and challenges with your team and admitting where you are stronger and weaker.
You take ownership by owning analyses and projects end to end.
Experiences that are essential
Strong coding ability in Python, SQL

To be comfortable writing test code, contributing to large libraries and the workflow that surrounds this e.g. proficiency with git and basic bash.
A solid grasp of machine learning with the ability to develop new algorithms when an innovative solution is necessary.
An excellent command of the standard libraries for data science (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Keras or equivalents in other programming languages).
An appreciation for the scientific method as applied to the commercial world; a talent for converting business problems into a mathematical framework; resourcefulness in overcoming difficulties through creativity and commitment; a rigorous mindset in evaluating the performance and impact of models upon deployment.
Eagerness to work with our customers and to learn about the non-technical aspects of the job.

"Data Scientist, B2B Marketing",£40K - £48K (Glassdoor Est.),"Why Deliveroo?

When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 5 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. Fast forward 5 years and we operate in 13 countries with over 50,000 riders who deliver orders from 50,000 restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide.

We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.

We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.

And we're just getting started

The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.

We are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in size every year. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.

ROLE

As the scale and complexity of Deliveroo grows, we're looking for a passionate and intellectually curious Data Scientist to join our expanding data science org and work closely with B2B Marketing and Performance Marketing teams. This is a perfect opportunity to become part of a team responsible for driving the strategic direction of our global business - with the global remit and opportunity to own and influence key projects and decisions on how we acquire, onboard and engage with our partners.

This role will be pivotal in demonstrating the impact that B2B Marketing has within Deliveroo globally. This could be on small scale projects like post campaign analysis of ad hoc comms, impact of webinars or large scale ROI impact of our complex CRM automated programs on our cohort of partners.

The successful candidate will have significant experience working in analytical roles and demonstrate a comprehensive knowledge of the marketing industry. They will be familiar with a wide range of tactics and technology commonly deployed by marketing teams and will use this knowledge to strategically identify and prioritise analytical opportunities.

The candidate will have advanced analytical, technical, and statistical skills, enabling them to identify appropriate opportunities and execute analysis with a statistically robust approach.

The ability to communicate effectively to a range of stakeholders with varying technical capabilities will be essential to success in the role.

The ideal candidate will recognise the pivotal role data plays in modern business and will take pride and joy in keeping their abilities at the forefront of the industry.

Life at Deliveroo

We are a growing team, with very large impact, seeking to answer some of the most interesting questions out there. We move fast, we're always looking for new ideas and we're very transparent about the decisions we make and why we make them.

There are so many questions we need to answer and plenty more we haven't even encountered. How do data and technology help restaurants to grow as consumer habits change? How can we predict what someone wants to order for dinner long before the idea has even crossed their mind? At Deliveroo these are just some of the tough problems we are solving - and there is no challenge that cannot be yours. No solution is owned by a particular team, which means the scope for growth and personal impact is enormous.

Benefits and Diversity

At Deliveroo we know that people are the heart of the business and we prioritise their welfare. We offer a wide range of competitive benefits in areas including health, family, finance, community, convenience, growth, time away and relocation.

In 2018 we announced our decision to give every employee equity in the company. We did this because we wanted all of our employees, regardless of location, level or role to be owners and because we believe that this is the right thing to do. We believe this helps build a culture where everyone is committed and able to share in the company's success.

We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start-up's around.

We work on small advisory or proof of value engagements all the way up to very large industrialised solutions across an array of public and private sector clients.
The focus of your role
If we believed all the stories about AI, then we'd be looking for budding magicians, wizards and sorcerers; but we don't. So, whilst the reality is still, quite frankly, fascinating, it is achieved through a lot of 'smarts', rather than magic fairy dust. We want passionate, energetic people who live and breathe all things AI, whether that be machine learning, deep learning, computer vision and so on, combined with great software engineering skills…no point creating great models if we can't deploy them! We want you to be thinking ""how can I use what I know?"", ""what do I need to learn?"", ""how can I build the best relationships with my clients"" in order to help achieve their business goals.
What you'll bring
We are looking to bring in people at all levels. The ideal candidate would have the skills necessary to thrive in a dynamic and fast paced environment but would also want to further both their technical skills and non-technical skills.

Things that would really impress us:
Not all of these skills are required and Capgemini offers training in any of these areas as well as access to the UK and international community of very technically highly skilled data scientists to learn from.",3.4,"Pontoon

Senior Data Analyst / Scientist,£30K - £39K (Glassdoor Est.),"iwoca started in 2012 and was born out of the frustration that small businesses lack the access to finance they need to reach their potential. Our belief then was that technology must enable us to significantly shorten the archaic 8-week bank application process which more often than not results in a ‘no’. Nearly a decade later and we have served more than 50,000 businesses across the UK and Germany with more than £2 billion of finance. Our personal best from a business starting an application to money in the bank is 3m26s (faster than Mo Farah on 1,500 meters). It’s a good start, but it’s just the beginning.
Our mission is to finance 1 million businesses, so still, a long way to go.
Through the course of our journey, we have learned that

About us

GWI was founded with the knowledge that understanding your audience is really important for business. When you know who you're speaking to and why, you can create content and campaigns that stand out to the people that matter.

Through our global online survey, we gather data on the behavior and perceptions of consumers across the world. This provides businesses with deep, actionable insights on their audience, revealed from data they trust.

It's been going well, too. Since launching in 2009, we've become one of the UK's fastest growing target audience companies, consistently renewing over 98% of our client base and doubling in size and revenue year-on-year. Our survey now represents more than 2 billion connected consumers, creating over 40,000 data points for clients including Twitter, Google, Spotify, WPP and Omnicom Group.

We're not about to stop growing any time soon. As a business, we're on a mission to re-engineer data-driven marketing, and we're on the lookout for talented people to join us.

About diversity and inclusion

Imagine if our data came from just one kind of person. We'd get a very nuanced view of the world. And we definitely wouldn't have got off the ground as a business. We're so lucky to live in a society where differences are celebrated – so we'd expect nothing else from our teams. In fact, the GWI office is as diverse as our global data, and it's really important to us that it stays that way. That means whatever your race, religion, sexual orientation or gender, this is a place to feel at home, express yourself freely and make your mark.

Our mission is to simplify pharmacy.
Echo is an exciting, cutting-edge tech organisation that has created a mobile app that allows people to manage their NHS repeat prescription orders online. Founded by patients, our mission is to simplify pharmacy and in doing so radically improve medicines adherence.
We spend £17bn on medicine every year, and half of all medicine isn’t taken as directed, this is a huge drain on NHS resources. Beyond waste, if people don’t take their medicine properly they are more likely to get ill. To deliver this we have to be agile, creative and challenge the status quo of dispensing. Echo is solving this by using technology to make it easier for patients to get and take their medicine. We aim to radically improve medicine adherence by making it easier for people to get, take and manage their meds.
Founded in 2015, we’re a diverse, inclusive team of 200 people based in Perivale or working remotely, where we run one of England’s busiest pharmacies. Echo was VC backed, until May 2019, at which point we were acquired by McKesson UK, who we partner with, while remaining fiercely independent. Now more than ever we have to ensure we deliver on this mission to enable elderly and vulnerable patients to get access to their medication, in a simple, safe and efficient way. Right now, Echo is directly making a significant impact on the fight against Covid-19.

About the Role
We are looking for a talented Data Analyst to join our Data team at Echo. We operate an embedded model, meaning that analysts are part of the data team, but day-to-day work with other teams. This analyst will be responsible for partnering with a team to ensure that data is underpinning decision making at all points of the journey. Echo is a data-driven business (we have analysts supporting product, marketing, finance and operations) meaning this role will play an essential part in driving success.

Responsibilities

Perform deep-dive analysis and provide actionable insights for multiple teams across the business
Maintain and develop Echo’s data model
Build ad hoc automated reports and dashboards

We’re a small team of developers, property specialists, data scientists and creatives, who are addressing one of the biggest and most life-changing problems our customers have: how they can get the security and freedom of homeownership for their families and for themselves.
Python (incl. numpy, scikit-learn, lightgbm, pandas, flask, fastAPI)
Postgres (incl. postGIS)

For the foreseeable future we are optimising for the majority of our team to be working remotely. We have an office in central London if you are unable to work from home. The current situation is a change for us, and we are still figuring out the best way to operate in this new reality. If there is some unusual way you want to work either short or long term, let us know, we are open to discussing it.
We are looking for our one and only Data Engineer, who will take ownership of our whole data landscape. You will be maintaining key data pipelines, scouting for new data sources, and creating single sources of truth for both property and customer data. You will work closely with data, backend, and devops, and make decisions how to implement stuff - after all you’ll know best if the solution should be an API endpoint or a batch job. Some of the problems you’ll be tackling first include, building property data pipelines, deploying and monitoring machine learning models, and organising customer and events data.
You will be working as a part of a small team of independent individuals, although cross-functionally tied to other parts of the business - primarily product and backend. You will be supported by experienced colleagues when you need it, and left to get on with it when you don't. The wider company is incredibly talented and you will be working closely with them on a regular basis. COVID-19 is currently interrupting our ability to get together and have fun, but we are still doing what we can (remotely) to keep each other laughing.
Important to note, if you are reading this and worrying that you don't have experience with one, some, or any of the items on this list, please still apply. All of the things here are trainable and are not required for a successful applicant.

The world is changing. We all want something different.

At Luno, we see you as an individual, and we want to unleash your potential and empower you to become the best possible version of yourself.

Luno welcomes crypto lovers and crypto newbies. You - just like everyone in the world - are on your own unique crypto-learning journey.

We are a mission-driven cryptocurrency company that is building more open and equal access to the future of money. You don't have to know lots about crypto to be interested in joining us, you just have to feel that upgrading the world to a fairer financial system matters, and that you'd like to be part of this global change. We're a passionate and committed team taking on a challenge of epic proportions. Like the first moon landing, it requires a special kind of people working together with unusual skill, focus and determination. We need the best team on board for our mission.

If that sounds like a culture you'd thrive in, then we are excited to hear from you.
A little about us

Luno means moon in Esperanto, we chose the name because at night, wherever you are in the world, you look up at the same moon. We believe in the power of working together, as one team, across borders, with clear focus and shared purpose.
Our popular mobile app and website helps people around the world grow and manage their money using the world's most mature cryptocurrencies: Bitcoin, Ethereum and USDC. We've processed over $21 billion to date.
Over 7 million customers across 40 countries have chosen to hold their crypto wallets on Luno because we offer a delightfully simple experience and bank-grade security.
We're part of the Digital Currency Group, named in 2021 as one of TIME magazine's 100 Most Influential Companies, in the ""Disruptors"" category alongside Tesla, AirBnB, SpaceX, Peloton. TIME noted that DCG is ""mainstreaming cryptocurrency"" .
We're proud to be one of the world's most international cryptocurrency teams, with colleagues from 43 different nationalities working across South Africa, Indonesia, the United Kingdom, Malaysia, Nigeria, Australia and Singapore. Financial inclusion is part of our mission, but on a deeper level, inclusion is a way of life, and a way of work for us. It is part of who we are as a company, and a group of human individuals.

How we work

We are a data-driven organisation that puts a huge emphasis on the scaling, storage, and query ability of our data.

Our engineering team (currently ~100 engineers) is split into organisations which we call Fleets. Each Fleet focuses on a core customer journey (onboarding, security, payments, support, new business, growth, and marketing, etc.). Each of these fleets contains multiple smaller teams called Pods, each of which focuses on a specific aspect of the product.

Pods will include a product owner, product designer, back-end engineers, Android, iOS, and Web developers, who each bring a unique perspective to the problem you are all contributing towards. We're agile, use scrum, continuous integration and continuous delivery, deploying to production every single day.

We're building teams to help us succeed in our mission to upgrade the world to a better financial system. You'll be joining a group of highly motivated software engineers with who you'll work collaboratively across our pods.

As a fast-growing company with offices around the world, you'll immediately see how your contributions directly impact both our internal users and client experience. Many of the problems we are solving result in trailblazing solutions which can't be found on Stack Overflow; so we're looking for engineers who flourish working in a complex domain.


Begin your journey at Luno by learning our processes, meeting the wider team, and starting our engineering onboarding program. After getting comfortable with the basics, you'll start learning our idiomatic patterns in a safe, easy-to-follow way: by building your set of own toy microservices. Here you will be involved in and experience our approach to design documents, code reviews, deployments, events, logging, and monitoring.

You will also meet the Pod(s) that you will be working with and quickly align on the teams' current OKRs and product roadmap. We succeed as a team, so we will provide you with regular feedback from your manager and peers and will encourage you to do the same.


Work closely with our data science team on projects introducing new data pipelines and ETLs

You'll have the opportunity to incrementally enhance, optimize and maintain our data lake as well as our AWS Redshift clusters

Use your passion in data engineering to innovate our data solutions and how to expose that data to the business

You'll apply new concepts regularly introduced within our engineering and product teams and apply these in data engineering


A relevant bachelors degree

Prior (2+ years) of experience as a software engineer

Proven track record of refactoring and performance tuning databases systems and queries

Worked on ETL, data pipelines and SQL

Experience with AWS Data related services

Don't be put off if you don't tick all of the boxes – they're a guide based on what we'd love to see but we appreciate that excellent software engineers have diverse backgrounds.

Do you want to work for a trailblazing company whose aim is to disrupt and better the world of healthcare?
Peppy's mission is to provide support in the moments that matter; when a couple is struggling to conceive, the journey through and post pregnancy, and dealing with menopause.
How does it work? Peppy is distributed as an employee benefit and all of our services are delivered through an app, where we connect users with real life practitioners.
We're already making a big impact. We’ve launched Peppy menopause to 700,000 members at Vitality. We’ve partnered with Santander, Aviva, SAP, Clifford Chance, BNP Paribas, Novartis and Wickes. We’ve delivered 3 hugely successful NHS trials.
This is just the beginning. We have huge growth plans and new services to launch including cancer support, men’s health, care for carers and much more.

We want you to own our reporting and solve complex requirements for different functions of this business. You’ll work closely with our engineering team and spend a lot of time working with different business functions.
Security is crucial for Peppy, so you will be designing and building cloud data processing infrastructure that is secure, efficient and scalable.

About you
You’re someone who is curious about what they are working on, meaning you'll want to engage with parts of the platform you don't know, and look for ways to improve it. You should be a tireless advocate of code quality - that means understanding the need for trade-offs in the short term whilst keeping us honest in the long term.

We are looking for a Data Engineer to join an exciting new team developing Insight solutions that will use analytics, AI and statistical processes to enhance our products capabilities and provide our healthcare clients with the right tools to continue to meet the rising patient need.
As a Data Engineer, you will be a key member of the product team working on our transactional and analytics databases.
You will be creating the scalable, efficient and testable production ready pipelines to move and transform the data using our CI/CD tool, as well as be responsible for modelling the data objects, designing the structure of the new schemas and improving the performance of queries.
You will have a key role in our nascent data function as you work cross-functionally with business domain experts, engineers, product analysts and client delivery teams. You’ll understand data and reporting requirements from our BI and will ensure the teams have the information they need in order to make key decisions using data.
This opportunity will allow you to have a direct effect on what we do and how we do it.
If you have a desire to learn and wish to accelerate your career, we can give you exposure to every facet of enterprise SaaS software and as much responsibility as you are ready to handle!


DrDoctor is a fast-growing digital health company founded in 2012. Our technology improves patient engagement, clinical outcomes and operational efficiency. We save the NHS millions of pounds each year and are currently deployed across 30 major hospitals around the UK. With over 10 million patients active on the platform already, we’re on a journey to deliver the tools to radically transform the delivery of health services to make healthcare work for everyone – for patients, doctors, administrative teams and tax payers.


Our current structure is based on the Spotify model, our pods are aligned to products and have the all the skills to do the work (think: engineers, product manager, designer).
Everyone at DrDoctor runs in two-week sprints and our pods have the autonomy to decide how they want to work and organise themselves around the problems they are trying to solve.
Our tech stack is primarily Microsoft based using C#, .NET, SQL and Angular with a sprinkling of interesting open source components, although we are happy using any framework or even none at all. We deploy changes to production multiple times a day using CI/CD pipelines and run our systems on a mixture of virtual machine and PaaS service based infrastructure hosted entirely on Azure cloud. We prefer to invest our talented engineers time in writing automated tests to keep our codebase healthy, rather than have dedicated QA/test roles.


In this role you really will interact with every part of the business on a daily basis, even as we grow!


'I'm Shane, and I work in the Data team. This team is relatively new, and we manage the usual tasks around unlocking insights from various data sources. Our mission is a little different though. It's not financial figures or social media data we're crunching. This data is used to help our wonderful NHS give patients the care they need quickly and efficiently. There aren't many data jobs where you can make an important contribution to the community like this - it's a good feeling.
Much of what's on our future roadmaps is greenfield, that's pretty exciting. It means we need ambitious people with open minds, big imaginations and bags of drive. People who are willing to explore and learn and can collaborate and share their knowledge on projects not just with developers but every person that makes up the DrDoctor team.
This is a company with big plans and one that is tangibly scaling-up. Pre-Covid the headcount here was under 40. That number has easily doubled since (and that includes yours truly). Our challenge is to ensure everything we build is secure, flexible and scalable, and can keep pace with a flourishing company.
Plus we're a friendly and sociable bunch of people who come from all around the world and all walks of life. And we like a laugh.'

Data Engineer,£50K - £65K (Glassdoor Est.),"We’re The Very Group, home to Very.co.uk, Littlewoods.com and a team of 4,000 super-talented people.
We’re the UK’s largest integrated digital retailer and financial services provider, and we’ve been helping customers say yes when it matters most for over 100 years. In that time, we’ve consistently reinvented our business to adapt to economic conditions and industry changes – going from bricks, to clicks, to mobile.
But despite our passion for reinvention, we’ve never wavered from our purpose; to make good things easily accessible to more people. It means giving our customers the brands they love, an outstanding shopping experience and flexible ways to spread the cost.
We’ve continued to deliver for our customers throughout the Covid-19 outbreak – and we’ve done it by transforming the way we work. The role itself will be a mix of on-site vs remote, we've adapted well to remote ways of working and will continue to embrace those practices moving forward.
We’re fired up for the future and the next stage in our development. We’ll give customers access to more great brands for themselves and their families, a seamless shopping experience and even more control of their finances through innovation in flexible ways to pay.
Ready to reinvent?
About the role
We are on quite an ambitious journey to modernise our Data domain, using new cutting edge technology. This Data domain feeds our Data Science, Analytics, Strategy and Engineering teams.
This role will sit within a Data Squad and is a multi-faceted role. You'll be developing robust, well tested, well-documented solutions for deployment in a cloud-based environment.
You'll be analysing, designing, architecting and developing data solutions for deployment to the data lake and data warehouse, and will be a key part of the team.
Skills
We focus on attracting good all round people to the business, as opposed to basing it purely on a technical skill set. Our cultural side of things is just as important as the technical side. Obviously, you'd need experience in certain areas to be able to carry out the role efficiently, so I have listed a few below:
Experience with one or more programming language such as Scala, Python or Java
Cloud technology experience (AWS, Azure or Google Cloud)
Working knowledge of test tools and frameworks such as JUnit, Mockito, ScalaTest or pytest
Experience in building data pipelines
Package
Benefits allowance (use to add things like healthcare, life assurance etc)
27 days holiday + bank holidays + option to buy or sell 5
Private pension matched at 6%

Who are we?

We're Mediahub. A growing global media agency built specifically for challenger brands looking to challenge the status quo.

It is our secret sauce – media creativity – that truly differentiates us. In a world with more ad blockers and ad-free environments, ever greater media fragmentation and growing attention scarcity, not all impressions are equal. We believe this makes creativity the most powerful economic multiplier any media agency can leverage and is a critical ingredient for challenger brands seeking an unfair share of attention.

Although part of the MullenLowe Group, we are powered by IPG's Mediabrands and have access to all the resources, intelligence, and buying power associated with the largest media companies, but remain small enough to provide clients with our best people and move with great alacrity.

Other data products will be powered by machine learning algorithms to solve predictive forecasting or classification problems for our customers - It's a fantastic opportunity to build something from scratch that makes a huge impact!

The Data Engineer will have strong technical knowledge relative to their years of experience but also a keen appreciation for the role devops plays in engineering practices and culture. We are looking for engineers at both mid and senior experience levels as we are more driven by a colleagues contribution and skills than length of service, and as a fast growing start-up we have flexibility in exact skills requirements in order to build the best team. Successful candidates will probably have significant experience in some of these areas; data engineering (e.g. Python, Kafka, Spark, Aurora Postgres, Airflow etc) and container engineering (e.g. ECS, Docker, Kubernetes etc).
This is a fully hands on position. Experience with Python, Spark and SQL will be essential while experience with AWS, CircleCI (or other automated build platforms), Terraform, Ansible and Datadog are nice to have. This is not a role for a pure sysadmin or platform engineer, it is a software engineering role with platform infrastructure elements and would particularly suit engineers who have experience with programming in Python but who are also comfortable with creating infrastructure resources using Terraform. Engineers who have a self-motivated interest in developing their own devops practices and supporting the wider engineering community at Streetbees will find a collaborative environment and a supportive blameless culture.
Responsibilities
Developing and maintaining data pipelines for our Data Lake, ML training loops and data operations workflows
Working closely with the Data Operations and BI teams to support their activities with data transformations and new data sources
Playing an integral role in implementing our Data Strategy
Hands-on design, development and support of infrastructure in collaboration with the rest of the platform engineering team. Active pull request participation, branch management, code reviews etc
Creating and managing infrastructure as code using Terraform and Atlantis
Investigating bugs and performance issues and providing support to the product engineering teams
Working closely with developers and product managers to ensure that data infrastructure requirements are implemented correctly and efficiently
Being an active part of the group of engineers reviewing and making key tech design decisions, and coordinating work and operations on our platform architecture
Sharing knowledge within the engineering team and data analysts using presentations, demos and pair programming
Working on production deployment of Machine Learning AI solutions (DataOps for machine learning is a new area for the industry, with little current conventional best practice, Streetbees expertise in ML creates a real opportunity to do leading-edge DataOps work productionising that)
Keeping up to date with the latest evolutions in engineering best practice and technologies
Requirements
Experience with Python including pyspark, pandas, numpy is essential
Knowledge of Ruby would be beneficial but not essential
Experience with Spark, AWS Glue, Athena, Delta Lake, Redshift
Experience managing relational databases (we use Aurora Postgres)
Experienced with the AWS cloud platform
Experience with containers and scheduling tools (we use Docker on ECS)
Experience managing infrastructure as code with Terraform
Experience working with CI/CD pipeline tools such as CircleCI, Jenkins etc
Benefits
